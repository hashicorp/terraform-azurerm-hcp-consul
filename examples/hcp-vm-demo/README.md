# hcp-vm-demo

This example creates all of the Azure and HCP resources necessary for connecting a
HCP Consul cluster to a Consul client on Azure VM.

### Prerequisites

1. Create a HCP Service Key and set the required environment variables

```
export HCP_CLIENT_ID=...
export HCP_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

2. Log into Azure via the Azure CLI, and set the correct subscription. More details can be found on the [Azure Terraform provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/azure_cli).

```
az login
az account set --subscription="SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
```

3. Create RSA keys if you don't already have them. Used for [SSH access to the Azure VMs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/linux_virtual_machine).

```
if [ ! -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ]; then
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
fi
```

### Deployment

1. Initialize and apply the Terraform configuration

```
terraform init && terraform apply
```

### Accessing the Deployment

#### HCP Consul

The HCP Consul cluster can be accessed via the outputs `consul_url` and
`consul_root_token`.

#### Nomad

This example is running on nomad, which can be accessed via the outputs `nomad_url` with the username `nomad` and `consul_root_token`.

#### VM instances

**Warning**: This instance, by default, is publicly accessible on port 8080 and 8081,
make sure to delete it when done.

The Azure VM applications be accessed via the `hashicups_url` output, providing URL to the demo app.
